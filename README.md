# Simulation-of-a-Nuclear-Leak-from-the-Fuel-Rod-Crack

## INTRODUCTION

In a nuclear reactor, the coolant is used to remove the waste heat from the cycle. In a 
typical PWR, there are three cycles which are primary, secondary, and tertiary cycles. 
The primary cycle is the cycle that mostly interacts with the radioactivity in the reactor 
core.

However, if a crack occurs in the fuel rods, from this crack nuclear materials can leak to the coolant. 
To avoid an environmental disaster, NRC‚Äôs limit of 131-I concentration in the water is 4x10^4  Bq/g for PWRs. 

In this study, the PWR‚Äôs thermal power is 3411 MW_th with the operation pressure of 15.5 MPa, and the inlet 
and outlet temperatures of 286‚ÑÉ and 326‚ÑÉ, respectively. In our fuel rods, some cracks occur about 2%. 
From these cracks 131-I leaks to the coolant about 9x10^(-8) per cycle. In addition to these, 0.029 atoms 
of 131-I are produced from each fission.

The coolant stays in the reactor for ùë°(1) seconds and completes the rest of the cycle in ùë°(2)
seconds. Every time that the coolant enters the reactor for ùë°1 seconds, it becomes more 
reactive because of the leaking. So, one of the main purposes is to calculate the 
concentration of 131-I in the water that goes to the environment in the frame of NRC‚Äôs 
limitations.
